# Web Scraping Project: The Evolution of NBA Finals Teams
### Main Focus: Web Scraping
I scraped https://www.basketball-reference.com using the Selenium library, specifically for pages containing:
- Regular season player data dating back to 1950, including pages with:
    -  per game stats
    -  advanced stats
    -  season totals
    -  mvp award shares
-  Playoff data dating back to 1950
    -  per game stats
    -  advanced stats
    -  playoff totals
-  NBA champions and runner-ups dating back to 1950
-  Every player bio in NBA history (dating back to 1946)


### Data Processing
I primarily used the Pandas library to clean-up and join data where appropriate.

### Analysis
I focused on all NBA Finals teams since 1950 to see how these players have evolved in terms of average height and their rate of 3 point attempts. I ultimately weighted the average height of players by win-shares (explanation metric: https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html).
