# Web Scraping Project: The evolution of NBA champions and runner-ups
### Main Focus: Web Scraping
I chose to scrape https://wwww.basketball-reference.com, specifically for pages containing:
- Regular season player data dating back to 1950, including pages with:
    -  per game stats
    -  advanced stats
    -  season totals
    -  mvp award shares
-  Playoff data dating back to 1950
    -  per game stats
    -  advanced stats
    -  playoff totals
-  NBA champions and runner-ups dating back to 1950
-  Every player bio in NBA history (dating back to 1946)

Also utilized Pandas along with other libraries to clean-up and join data where appropriate.

### Analysis
After scraping and processing data, I decided to narrow focus on NBA champions and runner-ups since 1950 to see how the composition of these teams have evolved since then.
